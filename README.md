# Session Notebook 📒

Welcome to my **session-notebook** repository.

Here I collect all notes, exercises and small code snippets that I create during my web development bootcamp at **neue fische**.  
I also add my own additional explanations, examples and links so that I can quickly find useful information later while coding.

This repository is my personal **learning knowledge base**. 🚀


## Goals of this repository

- 📚 Central place for all notes from bootcamp sessions  
- 🧠 Save my own insights, tips and tricks  
- 💻 Keep small code examples that I can reuse in future projects  
- 🔍 Make it easy to search for solutions when I get stuck during development  


## Folder structure

- `css/` – notes and examples about CSS (selectors, box model, flexbox, etc.)
- `html/` – notes about HTML basics and semantic structure
- `javascript/` – JavaScript basics, exercises and small scripts
- `shell-and-git/` – commands and examples for working with the shell and Git/GitHub
- `github-and-markdown/` – information about GitHub workflow and Markdown syntax
- other files – additional topics, session summaries or experiments


## How I use this notebook

- After each session I add new notes or update existing ones.
- When I learn something new, I try to write a **short explanation in my own words**.
- If I find a useful snippet or command, I save it here with a short comment.
- When I work on a new project, I can quickly come back here and reuse what I already learned.


## Naming & structure

- Files are usually named by **topic** (e.g. `flex.md`, `git-branches-and-PRs.md`).
- I try to keep one main topic per file to make searching easier.
- Over time I may refactor and reorganize folders when topics grow.


## Future plans

- Add more examples and screenshots for complex topics.
- Extend JavaScript notes with more practical mini-projects.
- Create small checklists (e.g. “HTML page setup”, “Git workflow reminder”, etc.).
- Keep everything up to date during the whole bootcamp.
